Sir, unable to complete the given question because we never worked on fastify.js and I tried hard to develop the api but can't able to do it sir. 
Thank you for your consideration sir.

sir, I have done the question using different way 
code:
import Vue from 'vue'
import Router from 'vue-router'

Vue.use(Router)

router.get("/g",(req, res) => {
   res.redirect('https://www.google.com/')
});
